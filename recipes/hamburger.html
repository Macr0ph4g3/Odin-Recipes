    <p>This is how you make a hamburger though honestly anyone should be able to slap beef on a grill and put it between two bread buns.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds of ground beef</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>Two buns</li>
        <li>Some pickles</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the ground beef on a skillet and let it cook until brown</li>
        <li>While the beef is browning, toast the buns</li>
        <li>Once the beef is done, put it between the two buns</li>
        <li>add your onions on top</li>
        <li>add your pickles, enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
